# Heart-Disease-Prediction


## Abstract
Machine Learning is used across many ranges around the world. The healthcare industry is no exclusion. Machine Learning can play an essential role in predicting presence/absence of locomotors disorders, heart diseases and more. Such information, if predicted well in advance, can provide important intuitions to doctors who can then adapt their diagnosis and dealing per patient basis. We work on predicting possible heart diseases in people using Machine Learning algorithms. In this project we perform the comparative analysis of classifiers like decision tree, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM and Random Forest and we propose an ensemble classifier which perform hybrid classification by taking strong and weak classifiers since it can have multiple number of samples for training and validating the data so we perform the analysis of existing classifier and proposed classifier.

## Conclusion
Heart diseases are a major killer in India and throughout the world, application of promising technology like machine learning to the initial prediction of heart
diseases will have a profound impact on society. The early prognosis of heart disease can aid in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high-risk patients and in turn reduce the complications, which can be a great milestone in the field of medicine. The number of people facing heart diseases is on a raise each year. This prompts for its early diagnosis and treatment. The utilization of suitable technology support in this regard can prove to be highly beneficial to the medical fraternity and patients. In this paper, the seven different machine learning algorithms used to measure the performance are Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and MLP applied on the dataset. 

All the seven machine learning methods accuracies are compared based on which one prediction model is generated. Hence, the aim is to use various evaluation metrics like confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score which predicts the disease efficiently. Comparing all seven the extreme gradient boosting classifier gives the highest accuracy of 84.5%.
