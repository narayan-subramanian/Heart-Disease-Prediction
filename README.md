# Heart-Disease-Prediction


Abstract
Machine Learning is used across many ranges around the world. The healthcare
industry is no exclusion. Machine Learning can play an essential role in
predicting presence/absence of locomotors disorders, heart diseases and more.
Such information, if predicted well in advance, can provide important intuitions
to doctors who can then adapt their diagnosis and dealing per patient basis. We
work on predicting possible heart diseases in people using Machine Learning
algorithms. In this project we perform the comparative analysis of classifiers
like decision tree, Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM and Random Forest
and we propose an ensemble classifier which perform hybrid classification by
taking strong and weak classifiers since it can have multiple number of samples
for training and validating the data so we perform the analysis of existing
classifier and proposed classifier.
